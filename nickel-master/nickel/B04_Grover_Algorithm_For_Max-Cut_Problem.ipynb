    "#  Grover Algorithm for Max-Cut Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we are ready to implement the Grover algorithm for the Max-Cut problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the initialization, we will apply Hadamard gate to the qubits representing the color of each vertex. We know how to implement the Grover diffusion operator. Now we need to implement an oracle which will \"mark\" the colorings in which there are $k$ edges whose endpoints are colored using different colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the oracle, the procedure goes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implement edge checking for each edge (check whether an edge has endpoints with different colors).\n",
    "* Sum the outputs of edge checking step.\n",
    "* Check whether the sum is equal to (or greater) $k$ and save the flag on the auxillary qubit.\n",
    "* Apply $Z$ gate on the auxillary qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The oracle works for the decision version of the problem which checks whether there exists a coloring such that there are at least $k$ edges whose endpoints are colored using different colors. How to find the maximum size for the cut?\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that $k$ is a three-digit number $b_2b_1b_0$. First, we should check whether there is a coloring such that $b_2$ is equal to 1. If it is, then we check if there is a coloring such that $b_2=1$ and $b_1=1$. Otherwise, we should check for the coloring such that $b_2=0$ and $b_1$=1. This way, by doing the binary search over binary representation, we can finally find the cut of maximal size."

    "We have successfully implemented the Grover's Search algorithm for the Max-Cut problem. Congratulations! However, there are several interesting additional facts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently for each edge, we have a separate qubit. We could reuse a single qubit at the cost of additional quantum gates. While the circuit would be longer, we could save some qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, for each task, the number of iterations was given. While for bipartiteness checking we know there are always exactly two answers, this may not be the case for the Max-Cut problem. Fortunately, there is a *quantum counting algorithm*, which can efficiently determine the number of solutions and hence the number of iterations."
