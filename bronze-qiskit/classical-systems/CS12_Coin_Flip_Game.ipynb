    "\n",
    "If we consider this coin as a system with two states (heads and tails: respectively, states 0 and 1), then we can say that after one iteration it is in states 0 and 1 with probabilities 0.3 and 0.7, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a probabilistic bit is in states 0 and 1 with probabilities $ p $ and $ 1-p $, where $ p $ is a number between 0 and 1. Remark that if $  p=1 $ or $ p=0 $, then the bit becomes deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the above biased coin is tossed once more, the probabilisties of the getting heads and tails (or being in the states in 0 and 1) will still be the same. In the following game, by using two biased-coins, we will be able to have different probabilities for the states 0 and 1. This game is our first step to define a probabilitic operator for probabilistic bits."
